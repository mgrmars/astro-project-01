# Adrian's website

This project is my personal website, featuring four main sections: Home, About, Blog, and Contact. The Home section gives a brief introduction to who I am and what I do. The About section provides a deeper insight into my personality, interests, and experiences. The Blog section includes regular posts about my thoughts, reflections, and adventures. The Contact section allows visitors to easily reach me. The website is designed to be a personal and accessible representation of who I am and what I do.

This website is developed using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), is not finished yet.
